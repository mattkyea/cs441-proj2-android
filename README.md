## Swiping:
### https://developer.android.com/training/gestures/detector#java
I started here and got basic movement/down presses working, but didn't understand how I could check direction,
as it wasn't a function I could override.

### https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4139288/android-how-to-handle-right-to-left-swipe-gestures
I used the second answer as a jumping off point, but made it a bit simpler (I didn't need anything super-accurate). This was a big help, and I focused on understanding how/why it worked rather than just copying it. Thus, I've added comments to my version.
